For the Introduction to Electrical Systems (IES) assignment, I conducted an in-depth analysis of electrical transformers and DC motors using MATLAB Simulink and Simscape libraries. The main objective was to investigate the behavior of transformers during open and short-circuit conditions, as well as to analyze the performance of a DC motor under varying resistance, current, and speed settings.

Transformer Analysis: The transformer analysis focused on its open-circuit and short-circuit performance. Using MATLAB simulations, I calculated key parameters such as mutual inductance, self-inductance, and resistance. The open-circuit test provided insights into the iron and copper losses of the transformer, while the short-circuit test helped identify the transformerâ€™s equivalent resistance and reactance.

DC Motor Analysis: The DC motor was evaluated by varying its armature resistance, field current, and voltage. I measured the motor's speed in radians per second (rad/s) and revolutions per minute (rpm) under different operating conditions. This allowed me to understand the relationship between electrical inputs and mechanical output, including speed variations and efficiency.

This assignment enhanced my understanding of key electrical system components such as transformers and DC motors, as well as their behavior under different operating conditions.
